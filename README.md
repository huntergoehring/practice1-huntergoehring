What do you tell people about your field of study at a party?

I tell people it's a lot of work, but I find it to be staisfying and fun.

In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been doing at work/study?

I've worked with statistics, written proofs and written lots of code.

What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?

I use a planner to keep track of things, work on getting one thing done at a time and force myself to be productive for at least a minimum amount of time each day.
